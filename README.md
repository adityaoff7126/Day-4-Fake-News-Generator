# Fake News Headline Generator

## Overview  
This is a simple Python program that generates random fake news headlines using predefined lists of celebrities, actions, objects, and locations.  
Each run produces a new headline that looks realistic but is completely fake.

This project is ideal for beginners who want hands-on practice with Python fundamentals.

---

## How It Works  
The program randomly selects:
- One celebrity  
- One action  
- One object  
- One location  

These elements are combined into a headline like:

Breaking News: Virat Kohli launches a new startup in Mumbai

After displaying a headline, the program asks the user whether they want to generate another one.  
If the user enters `y`, a new headline is generated.  
Any other input ends the program.
